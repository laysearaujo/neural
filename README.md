# ðŸŒŸ Neural Networks

This is a personal project aimed at learning and building various types of neural network architectures from scratch. The repository is structured to explore each model in its own folder, providing an in-depth understanding of its workings and applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each folder in the repository represents a specific neural network model. Inside each folder, you'll find:
- A **README** with an explanation of the model, its purpose, and key concepts.
- The **code implementation** of the model from scratch.
- Examples and experiments demonstrating the model in action.

### Current Structure

| Folder        | Description                                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `perceptron/` | The simplest neural network, used for binary tasks.   |
| `feedforward/`| Basic multi-layer networks for general tasks.         |
| `cnn/`        | Convolutional Neural Networks, ideal for image data.  |
| `rnn/`        | Recurrent Neural Networks, for sequential data.       |
| `lstm/`       | Long Short-Term Memory networks, improving on RNNs.   |
| `gan/`        | Generative Adversarial Networks, for generating data. |
| `transformer/`| Advanced architectures for NLP and other tasks.       |
